# SKILL Tools


This is my personal set of tools written for working with SKILL in Cadence virtuoso.

The main feature of interest is the unit testing framework in the folder `qtest`.

## Namespaces used
### qub
This currently contains all code other than the testing framework.
It is a catch-all namespace.

### qtest
This contains all code relating to unit testing.

## Unit Testing

The unit testing framework is modelled after [Python's unit test module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and provides a basic set of assertions for testing your code.

### Main Functions

## runAllTests

This takes a relative folder path and loads all modules prefixed with test_

## runTests



## Importing the module
